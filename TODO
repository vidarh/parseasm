- KLN can't take #/" " currently (workaround: place it in ())
- Hex numbers in BNF generator doesn't work
- Or priority is awkward (would be better for it to take a sequence of rules
- Handling numeric ranges in sets: [#x01-#x08]
- Consider switching to using "^" for NOT in sets
- Quoting isn't done properly: '"^^' turns into req ""^^" and "'" turns into #'''
- Handle escapes in "req"/"try"
- "Match FOO until BAR batches" (with priority for bar:
    (Char* - "]]>") -> #1
    Translates into:
       try "]]>"
       beq _1
       ...
    :_1
       err
       
    NOTE: "*" applied to "outer" production not to char itself. Translates
    to English like this:

      Match as many Char's as possible such that the resulting string does
      not contain any characters that makes up the pattern "]]>"
